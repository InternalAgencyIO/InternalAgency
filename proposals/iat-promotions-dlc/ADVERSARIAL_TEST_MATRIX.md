# Adversarial test matrix

> **DRAFT / INACTIVE / NOT PART OF GENESIS / NOT DEPLOYED / NO CLAIM ROUTE**

This matrix describes the network-free reference tests. Passing it is not a
security audit or deployment approval.

| Invariant or attack | Test evidence | Expected result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Funding attempts to use a V2 or non-community lane | `activation requires isolated full funding...` | Rejected; original state unchanged |
| Activation before Genesis + 8 hours | same | Rejected |
| Activation on a non-mainnet binding | same | Rejected |
| Activation without separate review | same | Rejected |
| Pending nomination | `pending and cancelled nominations...` | Zero completed capacity and zero spend |
| Cancelled nomination | same | Reservation released; zero completed capacity and zero spend |
| Fake verifier result | `invalid and expired attestations...` | Rejected without state mutation |
| Expired verifier attestation | same | Rejected without state mutation |
| Exact paired accounting | `paired settlement pays exact amounts...` | 120/60 transfers, six role markers, one receipt |
| X handle changes after nomination | `a handle change is safe...` | Same immutable X commitment settles |
| Self-referral by X identity | `self-proposals are rejected...` | Rejected at nomination |
| Self-referral by node | same | Rejected at settlement |
| Self-referral by wallet | same | Rejected at settlement |
| Failure after modeled hero transfer | `settlement failure after either modeled transfer...` | Full rollback |
| Failure after modeled proposer transfer | same | Full rollback |
| Reused settlement attestation nonce | `attestation nonces cannot be replayed...` | Rejected; no second payment |
| Reused proposer wallet | `node, wallet, and X uniqueness...` | Rejected independently of node/X |
| Reused hero wallet | same | Rejected independently of node/X |
| Reused proposer node, wallet, or X identity | `every proposer and hero identity dimension...` | Each dimension independently rejects reuse |
| Reused hero node, wallet, or X identity | same | Hero X rejected at nomination; node/wallet rejected before settlement |
| Same node earns different roles once each | same | Accepted; role limits remain independent |
| Cancellation wins before settlement | `cancellation and settlement ordering...` | Settlement rejected; no payment or completed slot |
| Settlement wins before cancellation | same | Cancellation rejected; exactly one atomic pair remains paid |
| 1,000 completed pairs | `exactly 1,000 pairs...` | Exactly 180,000 IAT spent; vault reaches zero |
| Attempted pair 1,001 | same | Permanently rejected |
| Two candidates for final slot | `the final slot is serialized...` | First canonical settlement wins; other expires unpaid and releases reservations |
| Work after terminal state | final two tests | Rejected; state remains unchanged |
| Canonical-envelope key order ambiguity | `canonical JSON is stable...` | Same bytes and digest regardless of insertion order |
| Envelope payload or ID tampering | `payload, ID, signature...` | Rejected |
| Detached-signature tampering | same | Rejected by the supplied verification boundary |
| Unapproved verifier key or wrong campaign | same | Rejected |
| Overlong attestation or stale wallet proof | `attestation lifetime...` | Rejected before reference-engine use |
| Duplicate public outcome | `duplicate outcomes...` | Rejected |
| Transparency entry mutation or reordering | same | Hash-chain verification fails |
| Transparency-log truncation or rewrite | `published checkpoints...` | Prior public checkpoint verification fails |
| Canonical envelope to settlement | `verified envelopes drive...` | Verified minimal binding completes one exact pair |
| Random legal/illegal operation sequences | `randomized-state-machine.test.mjs` | Every invariant holds after every operation |
| Program interface claims a network or program ID | `network or deployment claims...` | Interface validator rejects the deployment claim |
| Account size or discriminator mutation | `layout and forbidden-account mutations...` | Interface validator rejects the binary-layout drift |
| Forbidden V2 account added to an instruction | same | Interface validator rejects the capability leak |
| Missing atomicity, six-marker, or terminal guard | `economic, vault, atomicity...` | Interface validator rejects the weakened contract |
| Deterministic instruction serialization | `published vectors encode...` | Every instruction matches its fixed public byte vector and round-trips |
| Missing, extra, malformed, negative, unsafe, or overflowing field | `the encoder rejects...` | Encoding fails before bytes are produced |
| Unknown discriminator, truncation, or trailing bytes | `the decoder rejects...` | Decoding fails without accepting an ambiguous instruction |

## Next matrix expansion

- verifier envelope byte-level fuzzing and real Ed25519 public test vectors;
- instruction/account transition adapter and property-based codec fuzzing;
- local-validator transaction rollback and account-lock contention.
